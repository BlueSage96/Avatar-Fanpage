					<dd>
						Aang was a male Air Nomad born in 12 BG and the avatar succeeding Avatar Roku.
						Also, he was the Avatar during the Hundred Year War.
						Right before the Hundred Year War began, Aang ran away from his home because
						he was not ready to be the avatar at the age of 12*. He left home during a
						storm which was so turbulent that he and Appa crashed into the ocean.
						Aang went into his Avatar State and frozen himself and Appa in an iceberg.
						Consequently, they remained there for one hundred years. During this time, the Air
						Nomads were massacred by the Fire Nation under Firelord Sozin who Also
						waged war upon the other nations. Katara and Sokka were gathering food when the iceberg
						with Aang and Appa emerged out of the water. Katara broke the ice using on of Sokka's weapons.
						When Aang emerged, still biologically twelve years old and the last  airbender alive.
						Young Aang was tasked with ending the Hundred Year War. In order to do this he had to
						master the other three elements (water, earth, fire) and defeating Fire Lord Ozai, the
						grandson of Firelord Sozin.
					</dd>

					<dt>Personality</dt>
					<dd>Despite his horrific loss and the heavy burdens he was forced to bear,
						Aang remained a kind and goofy kid at heart. He was also very shy around
						Katara at times because of his crush on her. He finally told her his feelings
						only for her to be hesitant. Aang was hurt at first and things became awkward
						between them. By the end of the series, they worked out their feelings for
						each other. Because of his Air Nomad upbringing he tried to see the best in
						everyone and did not want to kill since Air Nomads preached about peace and
						love for all living things. He even spared the Firelord's life in the last battle
						and opted to take away his bending instead. He was given this ability by a giant
						lion turtle.

					<dt>Background</dt>
					<dd>
						Katara was born in the Southern Water Tribe to Chief Hakoda and his wife Kya.
						Katara was the last waterbender in the South Pole during her childhood.
						This was a result of several Fire Nation Raids kidnapping or killing
						waterbenders in the South Pole. During one of these raids Katara and Sokka's
						mother Kya was killed when she lied and said she was the last waterbender in
						the South Pole saving Katara's life. Chief Hakoda left their village to fight
						in the Hundred Year War. Katara and Sokka where then raised by their grandmother,
						Kanna. During this time, Katara and Sokka found Aang and Appa frozen in an iceberg.
						They decided to accompany Aang to the Northern Water Tribe so he find a waterbending master.
						Katara fought to be trained by the Northern Water Tribe's waterbending master, Pakku because
						traditionally only men train to become waterbending masters. Katara became Aang's teacher
						after they left the Northern Water Tribe. Aang, Katara, and Sokka continued around the world
						while Aang also mastered Earth and Fire. Katara and Sokka helped Aang halt the Fire Nation's advancement
						and end the Hundred Years War.
					</dd>

					<dt>Personality</dt>
					<dd>
						Because she lost her mother at a young age Katara took on a motherly role in her family.
						Toph would often make fun of her personality. She became Team Avatar's parental
						which kept the group together during their toughest times. Katara also has a soft
						spot for children even ones from the Fire Nation which stems from losing her mother
						at a young age. She loves to help others and is very determined which sometimes annoyed
						other people especially Sokka.

					<dt>Background</dt>
					<dd>
						Sokka was born in the Southern Water Tribe to Chief Hakoda and his wife Kya.
						During a Fire Nation raid, Sokka and Katara's mother Kya was killed.
						Sokka admitted that he could not remember his mother and that he sees
						Katara when he thinks of his mother. Katara and Sokka where then raised by their grandmother,
						Kanna after their father left to fight into the war. He became the oldest male
						in the South Pole and became the leader of his tribe. Up until Sokka and
						Katara discovered Aang and Appa, Sokka busied himself by training for Fire
						Nation raids and trained the children who would become future warriors.
						Initially, he doubted Aang's ability to save the world and made fun of Aang's
						crush on Katara. By the end of the series, Sokka regarded Aang as a friend
						and was proud to be a member of Team Avatar. Sokka also serves as the strategist
						of the group and felt the need to prove that he was a great warrior. Part of this
						stems from the fact that he was the only member of the group that could not bend.
						During their travels, Sokka became a better leader and went on to be a mastermind
						behind a big Fire Nation invasion during the Day of Black Sun.
					</dd>

					<dt>Personality</dt>
					<dd>
						At the beginning of the series Sokka was sexist, immature, and skeptical of things
						he could not rationally explain. He was openly envious of Katara and Aang's bending abilities.
						By the third season, he questioned his usefulness in the group. Once he received
						swordsman training from a master he became more confident in his group role. Also,
						he was not pleased that Aang would have to learn Firebending due to his childhood experiences.
						He eventually accepted that Aang had to learn Firebending and accepted Prince Zuko as a remember
						of the group.

			<summary id="zuko">Zuko</summary>
				<img src="images/zuko.jpg" alt="Zuko">

					<dt>Background</dt>
					<dd>
						Zuko was born as the prince and son of Firelord Ozai.
						He was originally the main enemy of Team Avatar.
						Zuko spoke out of turn at a meeting to a Fire Nation general.
						He challenged this general to a Fire Bending duel called an
						Agni Kai. However, his father came to the fight. Firelord Ozai
						came because Zuko disrespected him by speaking out of turn during the
						meeting. When Zuko refused to fight his father Firelord Ozai decided to
						teach him a lesson about respect by burning his face. As a result,
						he has a distinctive burn scar on the left side of his face.
						The scar goes from eyebrow to cheek. Afterwards, Zuko was banished from
						the Fire Nation until he completed his mission to find Aang.
						Prince Zuko dedicated three years of his life to finding and capturing
						the Avatar no matter the cost. With support from his paternal uncle,
						General Iroh, and after much internal struggle and turmoil, Zuko rejected Ozai
						and his model of the Fire Nation. He instead joined the Avatar's group to become
						Aang's lifelong friend and firebending mentor. He was determined to end the
						Hundred Year War and restore both his and the Fire Nation's honor. While Aang
						fought Ozai during the final battle, Zuko, with the help of Katara, defeated his
						younger sister, Princess Azula, and took his place as Fire Lord,
						declaring the end of the Hundred Year War and the start of an era of love and peace.
						He also became a well respected Firebending master.
					</dd>

					<dt>Personality</dt>
					<dd>
						Zuko started off very hostile and angry to everyone including his Uncle Iroh.
						He only cared about capturing Aang and restoring his honor to the detriment of
						his soldiers. During season two, his sister Princess Azula killed Aang and allowed
						Zuko to take the credit. Firelord Ozai allowed him to return to the Fire Nation
						for the first time in three years. Initially, he was happy about this but came to
						realize that his Uncle Iroh was right about Avatar Aang trying to restore peace to
						the world and rejected his father's toxic idealogy. As a result, he became a more
						thoughtful and caring person. It took a while for Team Avatar, especially Katara,
						to trust him. However, he did everything he could and beyond (such as teaching Aang
						how to Firebend and helping Katara confront her mother's killer) to prove to the others
						that he was really their ally and friend. He apologized for trying to harm them and capture
						Aang. By the end of the series, everyone had embraced him with open arms and became
						lifelong friends with him.

			<summary id="toph">Toph</summary>
				<img src="images/toph.jpg" alt="Toph" id="TophImg">
				<dl>
					<dt>Background</dt>
					<dd>
						Toph was born blind and treated delicately by her parents.
						They tried to keep her safe and did not want her doing anything strenuous.
						Secretly, she learned how to earthbend after learning that badgermoles were
						earthbending animals that were also blind. She uses earthbending to "see" every
						vibration that goes through the ground. Toph also secretly participated in underground
						earthbending tournaments as the "Blind Bandit". When Aang saw her earthbending
						he asked her to become his earthbending teacher. At this point in her life, she
						found her overprotective parents to be unbearable and ran away with Team Avatar.
						She was initially uninterested in the war effort and just wanted to travel.
						During her time with Team Avatar she discovered metalbending.
					</dd>

					<dt>Personality</dt>
					<dd>
						Toph is fiercely independent, sarcastic, direct, stubborn, and confrontational.
						She appears to have the same carefree and adventurous personality as Aang and is
						very tomboyish in the way she acted and dressed, in contrast to the delicate doll
						her parents saw her as.

			<summary id="momo">Momo</summary>
				<img src="images/momo.jpg" alt="Momo">

					<dt>Background</dt>
					<dd>
						Momo is a winged lemur and a loyal companion of Team Avatar.
						He was living at the Southern Air Temple in late 99 AG. He is the only
						known specimen of the winged lemur species to still be alive after the
						Air Nomad Genocide.
					</dd>

					<dt>Personality</dt>
					<dd>
						Momo's personality is typical of his species: curious and intelligent.
						He is an asset to the team with his friendly and playful ways, often having
						comedic moments with Sokka. This brought much needed levity to the group from
						time to time. Although rare between different animal species, Appa and Momo
						possessed a special bond, which may be due partly to linguistic similarities,
						as they were capable of understanding one another's speech. Momo showed compassion
						and intelligence, and aided them in their escape while at the same time making valuable
						allies.He was also something of a glutton, and would often gorge himself
						on any available fruit.

			<summary id="appa">Appa</summary>
				<img src="images/appa.jpg" alt="Appa">
				<dl>
					<dt>Background</dt>
					<dd>
						Appa was Avatar Aang's faithful sky bison, who shared a strong bond with him and Momo because
						they were all some of the few remaining traces of the Air Nomad civilization. Appa is most noted
						for his ability to fly despite his heavy weight, which was achieved through airbending. He is the
						primary means of transportation utilized by Team Avatar.
					</dd>

					<dt>Personality</dt>
					<dd>
						Appa seemed to have a reasonably trusting attitude, as he didn't take long to accept the apple offered
						to him by Aang - to whom he became incredibly loyal - and took an immediate liking to Sokka when he first saw him.
						However, this trait was damaged due to his experience with the circus trainer and the sandbenders after he
						was kidnapped and sold. In these difficult moments, he seemed to have similar feelings toward humans when he missed
						Aang and his family in the Eastern Temple[1] while he tried his best to find Team Avatar.
