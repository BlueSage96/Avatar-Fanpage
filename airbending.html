					<dt>Background</dt>
					<dd>
						Air Nomads is a general term used to define the monastic order of men and women who
						practice the discipline of airbending and their seclusive, theocratic society.
						Air Nomads are nomadic by definition but had four air temples located at each corner
						of the globe. These temples were hidden atop mountain ranges and under cliffs. They
						were located in the Northern Earth Kingdom and on three remote islands. Every Air Nomad
						was a bender which is unheard of in other nations. This was because of their high level
						of spirituality. Air Nomads travel around the world riding on flying bison. Not only
						were they the most spiritual culture Air Nomads also lived in harmony with nature.
						Air Nomads were also known for their fun-loving nature and had a great sense of humor.
						The Air Nomads had the smallest nation and a small economy which depended almost entirely
						on limited agriculture.

						The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly problems and concerns.
						They believe that finding peace and freedom was the key to solving their
						difficulties in life. Airbenders continually sought spiritual enlightenment,
						and, as a result, all children born into the Air Nomads were benders.
						The first airbenders learned their art from the flying bison. Their detachment
						from the world and peaceful nature made it difficult to fight the Fire nation
						and resulted in their defeat.

						Airbending is done through the aerokinetic ability to control and manipulate air.
						Air is considered the element of freedom. An important aspect of airbending is flexibility
						and finding and following the path of least resistance. Airbending is famous for being
						almost entirely defensive and as the most dynamic of the four bending arts.
						Airbenders can overpower many enemies at one time by using large and powerful attacks that
						could be deadly; however, due to the peaceful personality of the Air Nomads, these type of attacks
					  are rarely used.

				<summary>Air Nomad Genocide</summary>

						<dd>
							<img id="genocide" src="images/air-nomad-genocide.jpg" alt="Air Nomad Genocide" />
						</dd>

						<dt>Summary</dt>
						<dd>
							The Air Nomad Genocide was a mass slaughter committed by the Fire Nation under Fire Lord
							Sozin that nearly wiped out the Air Nomads and the fauna that lived in the
							air temples. Avatar Aang was the only human survivor of this ferocious attack. He was
							Fire Lord Sozin's main target. There was severe backlash from the Earth Kingdom and Water
							Tribes after this cultural destruction. They declared war on the Fire Nation and thus the
							Hundred Year War begun.
						</dd>

						<dt>Preluding Events</dt>
						<dd>
							Fire Lord Sozin betrayed his childhood friend Avatar Roku and left him for dead after a
							one-on-one battle. Sozin knew that Avatar Roku's successor would be an Air Nomad so he
							decided in order to end the Avatar Cycle he would have to wipe out the Air Nomads.
							The surpise attack was timed to take place during the arrival of the Great Comet, later
							dubbed Sozin's Comet, as it gave his firebenders tremendous power advantage over the Air Nomads.
							Because of fear about an impending war, Aang was told by the Council of Elders that he was the
							Avatar at the age of twelve instead of the traditional age of sixteen. His guardian, Gyatso,
							wanted Aang to have a normal, carefree childhood and continued to play games and have fun with Aang.
							As a result, the rest of the Council of Elders and Pasang decided that it was necessary to separate
							Aang and Gyatso. They were going to send Aang to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his airbending
							training. Aang overheard this conversation, became overwhelmed with his new identity and responsibility
							so he ran away.
						</dd>


						<dt>Genocide</dt>

						<dd>
							Aang told Katara and Sokka the only way to get to an Air Nomad temple was by flying bison. He initally did
							not believe his people were actually dead because it would have been impossible for the Fire Nation to reach
							them. However, the Fire Nation found a way to reach the Air Nomad temples and commit the genocide. Some temples,
							like the Eastern Air Temple, suffered more damage than others while the Western Air Temple was nearly intact.
							Although the Air Nomads followed a pacifistic culture, they fought against the Fire Nation with a fair amount
							of success. The proof of this is the dozens of firebender bodies surrounding the remain of Monk Gyatso.
							Unfortunately, they were still no match against the massive numbers and firepower of the Fire Naton army.
							A tiny number of Air Nomads escaped the temple attacks and were difficult to track down. Fire Lord Sozin changed
							tactics and drew them out by using relics taken from temples and placed them in small homes high in the mountains.
							This gave these residences the appearance of Air Nomad refugees living in them. Then the Fire Nation used spies
							to spread rumors about the safe houses throughout the Earth Kingdom. Unfortunately, the remaining Air Nomad
							refugees fell for this trap and were captured and killed.

						<dd>Gyatso's corpse discovered by Aang</dd>

						<dd>
							As previously mentioned, Aang was the only known airbender to survive the genocide.
							He was racked with guilt for running away while his people fought the Fire Nation
							and died. Aang believed that if he had stayed he could have saved his people from
							the genocide. Meanwhile, Fire Lord Sozin spent the last two decades of his life searching
							for Aang who was encased in an iceberg underwater.
